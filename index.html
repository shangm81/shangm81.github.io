  <h1>Mingdi Shang</h1>
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p> I am a current master's student at the University of Pennsylvania in Electrical and Systems Engineering. </p>
  <p> I completed my Bachelor of Science in Engineering - Computer Engineering at Purdue University. My engineering interests and specializations are embedded and autonomous systems, digital design and verification, and computer architecture, especially in processor design. I am also interested in researching AI-assisted Natural language to RTL/HDL generation.  </p>
  <p> I also have relevant experience in serving as an undergraduate TA for ECE 33700 ASIC Design Laboratory in Fall 2024 under Professor Matthew Swabey and ECE 43700 Computer Design and Prototyping in Spring 2025 under Professor Mithuna Thottlethodi. I am also starting as a TA for CIS4710/5710 Computer Organization and Design at the University of Pennsylvania under Professor Joseph Devietti. </p>
  <h2>Projects SECTION PENDING SETUP</h2>
  <p> Due to academic integrity issues, none of my digital design codes or RTL diagrams will or can be posted publicly. Only coursework present here is my senior design project: the Autonomous Parking Enforcement Vehicle, in its nature as an open-source project</p>
